// About
// -----------------------------------------
I found the Jay Clegg's mod of the Peggy for use with a video
screen very useful. So I took it upon myself to create a library
for easier implemention in Processing

You can see his implementation and explanation of the project here:
http://www.planetclegg.com/projects/Twi2Peggy.html

Just to reiterate, this is not my code it is all Jay's (give or take a few
modifications needed to make it a library) 


// Change Log
// -----------------------------------------
 -	001
 *	created initial library


// Notes
// -----------------------------------------
If at any time Jay contacts me to remove this, I will gladly do so.
